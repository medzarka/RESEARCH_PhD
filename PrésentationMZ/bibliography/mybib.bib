  Abstract                 = {This paper presents novel methods for classifying images based on knowledge discovered from annotated images using WordNet. The novelty of this work is the automatic class discovery and the classifier combination using the extracted knowledge. The extracted knowledge is a network of concepts (e.g., image clusters and word-senses) with associated image and text examples. Concepts that are similar statistically are merged to reduce the size of the concept network. Our knowledge classifier is constructed by training a meta-classifier to predict the presence of each concept in images. A Bayesian network is then learned using the meta-classifiers and the concept network. For a new image, the presence of concepts is first detected using the meta-classifiers and refined using Bayesian inference. Experiments have shown that combining classifiers using knowledge-based Bayesian networks results in superior (up to 15%) or comparable accuracy to individual classifiers and purely statistically learned classifier structures. Another contribution of this work is the analysis of the role of visual and text features in image classification. As text or joint text + visual features perform better in classifying images than visual features, we tried to predict text features for images without annotations; however, the accuracy of visual + predicted text features did not consistently improve over visual features.},

In image interpretation, computer vision and structural recognition, the management of imperfect information and of imprecision constitutes a key point. This calls for the framework of fuzzy sets, which exhibits nice features to represent spatial imprecision at different levels, imprecision in knowledge and knowledge representation, and which provides powerful tools for fusion, decision-making and reasoning. In this paper, we review the main fuzzy approaches for defining spatial relationships including topological (set relationships, adjacency) and metrical relations (distances, directional relative position).},

  Abstract                 = {The need to deal with vague information in Semantic Web languages is rising in importance and, thus, calls for a standard way to represent such information. We may address this issue by either extending current Semantic Web languages to cope with vagueness, or by providing a procedure to represent such information within current standard languages and tools. In this work, we follow the latter approach, by identifying the syntactic differences that a fuzzy ontology language has to cope with, and by proposing a concrete methodology to represent fuzzy ontologies using \{OWL\} 2 annotation properties. We also report on some prototypical implementations: a plug-in to edit fuzzy ontologies using \{OWL\} 2 annotations and some parsers that translate fuzzy ontologies represented using our methodology into the languages supported by some reasoners. },

  Abstract                 = {{W}e describe a simple new technical for spatio-temporal segmentation of video sequences. {E}ach pixel of a 3{D} space-time video stack is mapped to a 7{D} feature point whose coordinates include three color components, two motion angle components and two motion position components. {T}he clustering of these feature pointsprovides color segmentation and motion segmentation, as well as a consistent labeling of regions over time which amounts to region tracking. {F}or this task we have adopted a hierarchical clustering method which operates by repeatedly applying mean shift analysis over increasingly large ranges, using at each pass the cluster centers of the previous pass, with weights equal to the counts of the points that contributed to the clusters. {T}his technique has lower complexity for large mean shift radii than ordinary mean shift analysis because it can use binary tree structures more efficiently during range search. {I}n addition, it provides a hierarchical segmentation of the data. {A}pplications include video compression and compact descriptions of video sequences for video indexing and retrieval applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Since achieving W3C recommendation status in 2004, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been successfully applied to many problems in computer science. Practical experience with OWL has been quite positive in general; however, it has also revealed room for improvement in several areas. We systematically analyze the identied short-comings of OWL, such as expressivity issues, problems with its syntaxes, and deficiencies in the definition of OWL species. Furthermore, we present an overview of OWL 2--an extension to and revision of OWL that is currently being developed within the W3C OWL Working Group. Many aspects of OWL have been thoroughly reengineered in OWL 2, thus producing a robust platform for future development of the language.},

  Abstract                 = {Probability theory and fuzzy logic have been presented as quite distinct theoretical foundations for reasoning and decision making in situations of uncertainty. This paper establishes a common basis for both forms of logic of uncertainty in which a basic uncertainty logic is defined in terms of a valuation on a lattice of propositions. The (non-truth-functional) connectives for conjunction, disjunction, equivalence, implication, and negation are defined in terms which closely resemble those of probability theory. Addition of the axiom of the excluded middle to the basic logic gives a standard probability logic. Alternatively, addition of a requirement for strong truth-functionality (truth-value of connective determined by truth-value of constituents) gives a fuzzy logic with connectives, including implication, as in Lukasiewicz' infinitely valued logic. A common semantics for all such variants is given in terms of binary responses from a population. The type of population, e.g., physical events, people, or neurons, determines whether the model is of physical probability, subjective belief, or human decision-making. The formal theory and the semantics together illustrate clearly the precise similarities and differences between fuzzy and probability logics. },

  Abstract                 = {{The amount of digital media that has to be actually managed has already become unaffordable without fine-grained computerised support. This requires an extensive use of multimedia metadata. MPEG-7 is the greatest metadata framework created to date but it is based on XML Schemas. Therefore, its does not have formal semantics, which makes difficult to manage, extend and integrate it. Consequently, there have been a lot attempts to move MPEG-7 to the Semantic Web. Our approach contributes a complete and automatic mapping of the whole MPEG-7 standard to OWL. It is based on a generic XML Schema to OWL mapping. The previous mapping is complemented with an XML metadata instances to RDF mapping that completes a transparent transfer of metadata from the XML to the Semantic Web domain. Once in a semantic space, data integration, which is a crucial factor when several sources of information are available, is facilitated enormously. We have used the generated MPEG-7 OWL ontology as an ” upper-ontology” for multimedia metadata, where three different music schemas have been linked. Thus, it has been possible to retrieve related information from instances of all the metadata sources. Furthermore, detecting and merging instances from different sources has allowed us to enhance the description of audio files, both content-based and editorial data.}},

In this paper, we propose an ontology of spatial relations, in order to guide image interpretation and the recognition of the structures it contains using structural information on the spatial arrangement of these structures. As an original theoretical contribution, this ontology is then enriched by fuzzy representations of concepts, which define their semantics, and allow establishing the link between these concepts (which are often expressed in linguistic terms) and the information that can be extracted from images. This contributes to reducing the semantic gap and it constitutes a new methodological approach to guide semantic image interpretation. This methodological approach is illustrated on a medical example, dealing with knowledge-based recognition of brain structures in 3D magnetic resonance images using the proposed fuzzy spatial relation ontology.},

  Abstract                 = {It is important to detect shot and sub-shot changes, which are the fundamental units of video sequences, in video indexing techniques. In this paper, a unified method for detecting shot and sub-shot changes is proposed using a background image. There are two steps used to detect shot changes. In the first step, pixel-wise differences using a new criterion are used to screen out less likely scene changes. The second step is based on the percentage of pixels having motion vectors different from the background image, and is applied to the candidate frames from the first step. To detect sub-shot changes, camera motion parameters are estimated from the background images. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust and accurate in detecting shot and sub-shot changes.},

  Abstract                 = {{Ontologies have become core components of many large applications yet the training material has not kept pace with the growing interest. This paper addresses the issues of why one would build an ontology and presents a methodology for creating ontologies based on declarative knowledge representation systems. It leverages the two authors experiences building and maintaining ontologies in a number of ontology environments including Protege-2000, Ontolingua, and Chimaera. It presents the methodology by example utilizing a tutorial wines knowledge base example.

  Abstract                 = {Despite the recent advances in search quality, the fast increase in the size of the Web collection has introduced new challenges for Web ranking algorithms. In fact, there are still many situations in which the users are presented with imprecise or very poor results. One of the key difficulties is the fact that users usually submit very short and ambiguous queries, and they do not fully specify their information needs. That is, it is necessary to improve the query formation process if better answers are to be provided. The proposed system is a revised concept-based query expansion technique, which allows disambiguating queries submitted to search engines. The concepts are extracted by analyzing log files and query relations mined using association rules. The concepts related to the current query are then shown to the user who selects the concept that he interprets is most related to his query. This concept is used to expand the original query and the expanded query is processed instead. Using a Web test collection of stock news articles this technique has been implemented and it can be clearly seen from the results that the proposed system leads to gains in precision. The proposed system attempts to improvise the performance of the vector space model system and provide relevant documents to the user based on the context.},

More specifically, the developed infrastruc- ture consists of the core ontology based on extensions of the {DOLCE} core ontology and the multimedia-specific infrastructure components. These are, the Visual Descriptors Ontology, which is based on an {RDFS} representation of the {MPEG}-7 Visual Descriptors and the Multimedia Structure Ontology, based on the {MPEG}-7 {MDS}. Furthermore, the de- veloped Visual Descriptor Extraction tool is presented, which will sup- port the initialization of domain ontologies with multimedia features.},

The probability theory is based on perception and has only two outcomes (true or false). Fuzzy theory is based on linguistic information and is extended to handle the concept of partial truth. Fuzzy values are determined between true or false. Fuzzy theory was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh as a means to model the uncertainty of natural language. From mathematical perspective, fuzzy and probability exist as part of information theory, which represent uncertainty. This paper describes about the similarity and difference between fuzzy and probability. Furthermore, the application of fuzzy logic in control system is described.},

  Abstract                 = {Shot boundary detection (SBD) is the process of automatically detecting the boundaries between shots in video. It is a problem which has attracted much attention since video became available in digital form as it is an essential pre-processing step to almost all video analysis, indexing, summarisation, search, and other content-based operations. Automatic \{SBD\} was one of the tracks of activity within the annual \{TRECVid\} benchmarking exercise, each year from 2001 to 2007 inclusive. Over those seven years we have seen 57 different research groups from across the world work to determine the best approaches to \{SBD\} while using a common dataset and common scoring metrics. In this paper we present an overview of the \{TRECVid\} shot boundary detection task, a high-level overview of the most significant of the approaches taken, and a comparison of performances, focussing on one year (2005) as an example.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we review 300 references on video retrieval, indicating when text-only solutions are unsatisfactory and showing the promising alternatives which are in majority concept-based. Therefore, central to our discussion is the notion of a semantic concept: an objective linguistic description of an observable entity. Specifically, we present our view on how its automated detection, selection under uncertainty, and interactive usage might solve the major scientific problem for video retrieval: the semantic gap. To bridge the gap, we lay down the anatomy of a concept-based video search engine. We present a component-wise decomposition of such an interdisciplinary multimedia system, covering influences from information retrieval, computer vision, machine learning, and human–computer interaction. For each of the components we review state-of-the-art solutions in the literature, each having different characteristics and merits. Because of these differences, we cannot understand the progress in video retrieval without serious evaluation efforts such as carried out in the NIST TRECVID benchmark. We discuss its data, tasks, results, and the many derived community initiatives in creating annotations and baselines for repeatable experiments. We conclude with our perspective on future challenges and opportunities.},

In this paper we survey several methods aiming at automating this time and resource consuming process. Good reviews on single modality based video indexing have appeared in literature. Effective indexing, however, requires a multimodal approach in which either the most appropriate modality is selected or the different modalities are used in collaborative fashion. Therefore, instead of separately treating the different information sources involved, and their specific algorithms, we focus on the similarities and differences between the modalities. To that end we put forward a unifying and multimodal framework, which views a video document from the perspective of its author. This framework forms the guiding principle for identifying index types, for which automatic methods are found in literature. It furthermore forms the basis for categorizing these different methods. },

  Abstract                 = {Large video collections such as YouTube contain many different video genres, while in many applications the user might be interested in one or two specific video genres only. Thus, when users are querying the system with a specific semantic concept like AnchorPerson, and MovieStars, they are likely aiming a genre specific instantiation of this concept. Existing methods treat this problem as a classical learning problem leading to unnecessarily complex models. We propose a framework to detect visual-based genre-specific concepts in a more efficient and accurate way. We do so by using a two-step framework distinguishing two different levels. Genre-specific concept models are trained based on a training set with data labeled at video level for genres and at shot level for semantic concepts. In the classification stage, video genre classification is applied first to reduce the entire data set to a relatively small subset. Then, the genre-specific concept models are applied to this subset only. Experiments have been conducted on a small 28-h data set for genre-specific concept detection and a 4168-h (80 thinspace031 videos) benchmark data set for genre-specific topic search. Experimental results show that our proposed two-step method is more efficient and effective than existing methods which do not consider the different semantic levels between video genres and semantic concepts for both the indexing and the search tasks. When filtering out 80% of the data set, the average performance loss is about 11.3% for genre-specific concept detection and 31.5% for genre-specific topic search, while the processing speed increases hundreds of times for different video genres.},
