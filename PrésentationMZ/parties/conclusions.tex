	\begin{itemize}
		\item The use of fuzzy knowledge based approach for video semantic 
		interpretation enhancement is an interesting research direction,
		
		\item With the obtained results, we demonstrated that such an approach 
		could help to resolve main multimedia community issues: \alert{semantic gap}, 
		and \alert{scalability},
		
		\item Further works are required to address more these issues. 
		Fortunately, more interesting research directions could be touched on.
