  Abstract                 = {The boom of Internet and multimedia technology leads to the explosion of multimedia information, especially image, which has created an urgent need of quickly retrieving similar and interested images from huge image collections. The content-based high-dimensional indexing mechanism holds the key to achieving this goal by efficiently organizing the content of images and storing them in computer memory. In the past decades, many important developments in high-dimensional image indexing technologies have occurred to cope with the `curse of dimensionality'. The high-dimensional indexing mechanisms can mainly be divided into three categories: tree-based index, hashing-based index, and visual words based inverted index. In this paper we review the technologies with respect to these three categories of mechanisms, and make several recommendations for future research issues.},

  Abstract                 = {Fuzzy Ontologies comprise a relatively new knowledge representation paradigm that is being increasingly applied in application scenarios in which the treatment and utilization of vague or imprecise knowledge are important. However, the majority of research in the area has mostly focused on the development of conceptual formalisms for representing (and reasoning with) fuzzy ontologies, while the methodological issues entailed within the development process of such an ontology have been so far neglected. With that in mind, we present in this paper IKARUS-Onto, a comprehensive methodology for developing fuzzy ontologies from existing crisp ones that significantly enhances the effectiveness of the fuzzy ontology development process and the quality, in terms of accuracy, shareability and reusability, of the process's output.},

  Abstract                 = {In the near future, the majority of personal computers are expected to have several processing units. This is referred to as core multiprocessing (CMP). Furthermore, each of the computation units will be capable of running multiple hardware threads. To benefit from the additional processing power, application developers should multithread their software. This paper studies the scalability (expected speedup factor) of multimedia applications and provides guidelines for proper utilization of these new multi-core platforms. In particular, we discuss the decomposition method, load balancing, synchronization primitives, interaction with the operating system and hardware issues such as cache hierarchy and memory bandwidth. Our results are based on analysis of several state-of-the-art applications, including H.264 video encoding, panoramic image stitching and dense optical-flow estimation. We demonstrate how to multithread them properly, and report scalability results on several next-generation multi-core platforms},

Under the aegis of set and lattice theories, we put together ingredients from mathematical morphology, description logics, and formal concept analysis. We propose computing the best explanations of an observation through algebraic erosion over the concept lattice of a background theory that is efficiently constructed using tools from formal concept analysis. We show that the defined operators are sound and complete and satisfy important rationality postulates of abductive reasoning. As a typical illustration, we consider a scene understanding problem. In fact, scene understanding can benefit from prior structural knowledge represented as an ontology and the reasoning tools of description logics. We formulate model based scene understanding as an abductive reasoning process. A scene is viewed as an observation and the interpretation is defined as the best explanation, considering the terminological knowledge part of a description logic about the scene context. This explanation is obtained from morphological operators applied on the corresponding concept lattice.},

  Abstract                 = {Research on the semantic gap has considered differences between user and computer image interpretations and proposed methods to bridge it. These methods have been verified by comparing results to reference data or by measuring the degree of user acceptance. Although these methods result in a narrower semantic gap between computers and users, the resulting model for a specific user and search goal may still not be satisfactory to other users. Through an image annotation task with users, we find that this discrepancy is caused by the subjective biases present in the bridging methods, which we refer to as the “linguistic semantic gap.” Based on our findings, efforts to bridge the semantic gap should include different user perspectives to compensate the individual subjective biases, by increasing the diversity of data sets used in the domain. Moreover, models derived from proposed bridging methods could be stored and further used by other systems.},

This paper presents an overview and an analysis of the use of semantic hierarchies and ontologies to provide a deeper image understanding and a better image annotation in order to furnish retrieval facilities to users.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined \{SURF\} (Speeded-Up Robust Features). \{SURF\} approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},

  Abstract                 = {This study presents two new clustering algorithms for partition of data samples for the support vector machine (SVM) based hierarchical classification. A divisive (top-down) approach is considered in which a set of classes is automatically separated into two smaller groups at each node of the hierarchy. The first algorithm splits the data samples based on a variation of the normalized cuts (NCuts) clustering algorithm wherein the weights of adjacency matrix are modified to utilize class membership in the process. The second algorithm also uses the \{NCuts\} clustering; however, it considers the involved classes rather than the individual data samples. It uses the minimum distances between the convex hulls of classes as a distance measure for determining the weights of the graph. Splits are determined for both algorithms based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of a Laplacian matrix, and it is observed that the proposed algorithms generate well-separated and well-balanced clusters. Unlike other clustering methods used for this purpose, the methods in the present study are found to be more suitable when \{SVMs\} are used as base classifiers. As demonstrated in the experiments, the proposed clustering algorithms are integrated into the hierarchical \{SVM\} classifiers, which results in significantly improved testing times with a negligible decrease in classification accuracies as compared to the traditional multi-class SVMs. },

Color features are among the most important features used in image database retrieval. Due to its compact representation and low complexity, direct histogram comparison is the most commonly used technique in measuring color similarity of images. A gamma membership function, derived from the Gamma distribution, has been proposed to find the membership values of the gray levels of the histogram. We present here an image retrieval scheme with some popular vector fuzzy distance measures using a gamma membership function for finding the membership values of the gray levels and evaluate the matching function to select the appropriate retrieval mechanism. },

  Abstract                 = {There have been many studies about how to help users enter more keywords into a search engine to find the most relevant documents or search results. Methods previously reported in the literature require a database to save the user profile, and construct a well-trained model to provide the potential “next keyword” to the user. Because the predictive models are based on the training data, they can only be used in a single knowledge domain. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called “Google latent semantic distance” (GLSD) and use it to extract the most important sequence of keywords to provide the most relevant search results to the user. Our method utilizes on-line, real-time processing and needs no training data. Thus, it can be used in different knowledge domains. Our experiments show that the \{GLSD\} can achieve high accuracy, and we can find out the most relevant information in the top search results in most cases. We believe that this new system can increase users’ effectiveness in both reading and writing articles. },

  Abstract                 = {Most decision tree classifiers are designed to classify the data with categorical or Boolean class labels. Unfortunately, many practical classification problems concern data with class labels that are naturally organized as a hierarchical structure, such as test scores. In the hierarchy, the ranges in the upper levels are less specific but easier to predict, while the ranges in the lower levels are more specific but harder to predict. To build a decision tree from this kind of data, we must consider how to classify data so that the class label can be as specific as possible while also ensuring the highest possible accuracy of the prediction. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has considered the induction of decision trees from data with hierarchical class labels. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm for learning decision tree classifiers from data with hierarchical class labels. Empirical results show that the proposed method is efficient and effective in both prediction accuracy and prediction specificity. },

  Abstract                 = {An approach to knowledge-assisted semantic video object detection based on a multimedia ontology infrastructure is presented. Semantic concepts in the context of the examined domain are defined in an ontology, enriched with qualitative attributes (e.g., color homogeneity), low-level features (e.g., color model components distribution), object spatial relations, and multimedia processing methods (e.g., color clustering). Semantic Web technologies are used for knowledge representation in the RDF(S) metadata standard. Rules in F-logic are defined to describe how tools for multimedia analysis should be applied, depending on concept attributes and low-level features, for the detection of video objects corresponding to the semantic concepts defined in the ontology. This supports flexible and managed execution of various application and domain independent multimedia analysis tasks. Furthermore, this semantic analysis approach can be used in semantic annotation and transcoding systems, which take into consideration the users environment including preferences, devices used, available network bandwidth and content identity. The proposed approach was tested for the detection of semantic objects on video data of three different domains.},

  Abstract                 = {Semantic Data Mining refers to the data mining tasks that systematically incorporate domain knowledge, especially formal semantics, into the process. In the past, many research efforts have attested the benefits of incorporating domain knowledge in data mining. At the same time, the proliferation of knowledge engineering has enriched the family of domain knowledge, especially formal semantics and Semantic Web ontologies. Ontology is an explicit specification of conceptualization and a formal way to define the semantics of knowledge and data. The formal structure of ontology makes it a nature way to encode domain knowledge for the data mining use. In this survey paper, we introduce general concepts of semantic data mining. We investigate why ontology has the potential to help semantic data mining and how formal semantics in ontologies can be incorporated into the data mining process. We provide detail discussions for the advances and state of art of ontology-based approaches and an introduction of approaches that are based on other form of knowledge representations.},

  Abstract                 = {Describing visual image contents by semantic concepts is an effective and straightforward way to facilitate various high level applications. Inferring semantic concepts from low-level pictorial feature analysis is challenging due to the semantic gap problem, while manually labeling concepts is unwise because of a large number of images in both online and offline collections. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically generate intermediate image descriptors by exploiting concept co-occurrence patterns in the pre-labeled training set that renders it possible to depict complex scene images semantically. Our work is motivated by the fact that multiple concepts that frequently co-occur across images form patterns which could provide contextual cues for individual concept inference. We discover the co-occurrence patterns as hierarchical communities by graph modularity maximization in a network with nodes and edges representing concepts and co-occurrence relationships separately. A random walk process working on the inferred concept probabilities with the discovered co-occurrence patterns is applied to acquire the refined concept signature representation. Through experiments in automatic image annotation and semantic image retrieval on several challenging datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concept co-occurrence patterns as well as the concept signature representation in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, we develop a method inspired by social network analysis to solve the semantic concept detection problem. The novel idea proposed is the detection and utilization of concept co-occurrence patterns as contextual clues for improving individual concept detection. We detect the patterns as hierarchical communities by graph modularity optimization in a network with nodes and edges representing individual concepts and co-occurrence relationships. We evaluate the effect of detected co-occurrence patterns in the application scenario of automatic image annotation. Experimental results on SUN'09 and OSR datasets demonstrate our approach achieves significant improvements over popular baselines.},

  Abstract                 = {Probability theory and fuzzy logic have been presented as quite distinct theoretical foundations for reasoning and decision making in situations of uncertainty. This paper establishes a common basis for both forms of logic of uncertainty in which a basic uncertainty logic is defined in terms of a valuation on a lattice of propositions. The (non-truth-functional) connectives for conjunction, disjunction, equivalence, implication, and negation are defined in terms which closely resemble those of probability theory. Addition of the axiom of the excluded middle to the basic logic gives a standard probability logic. Alternatively, addition of a requirement for strong truth-functionality (truth-value of connective determined by truth-value of constituents) gives a fuzzy logic with connectives, including implication, as in Lukasiewicz' infinitely valued logic. A common semantics for all such variants is given in terms of binary responses from a population. The type of population, e.g., physical events, people, or neurons, determines whether the model is of physical probability, subjective belief, or human decision-making. The formal theory and the semantics together illustrate clearly the precise similarities and differences between fuzzy and probability logics. },

  Abstract                 = {{The amount of digital media that has to be actually managed has already become unaffordable without fine-grained computerised support. This requires an extensive use of multimedia metadata. MPEG-7 is the greatest metadata framework created to date but it is based on XML Schemas. Therefore, its does not have formal semantics, which makes difficult to manage, extend and integrate it. Consequently, there have been a lot attempts to move MPEG-7 to the Semantic Web. Our approach contributes a complete and automatic mapping of the whole MPEG-7 standard to OWL. It is based on a generic XML Schema to OWL mapping. The previous mapping is complemented with an XML metadata instances to RDF mapping that completes a transparent transfer of metadata from the XML to the Semantic Web domain. Once in a semantic space, data integration, which is a crucial factor when several sources of information are available, is facilitated enormously. We have used the generated MPEG-7 OWL ontology as an ” upper-ontology” for multimedia metadata, where three different music schemas have been linked. Thus, it has been possible to retrieve related information from instances of all the metadata sources. Furthermore, detecting and merging instances from different sources has allowed us to enhance the description of audio files, both content-based and editorial data.}},

Practical experience with \{OWL\} has been quite positive in general; however, it has also revealed room for improvement in several areas. We systematically analyze the identified shortcomings of OWL, such as expressivity issues, problems with its syntaxes, and deficiencies in the definition of \{OWL\} species. Furthermore, we present an overview of \{OWL\} 2—an extension to and revision of \{OWL\} that is currently being developed within the \{W3C\} \{OWL\} Working Group. Many aspects of \{OWL\} have been thoroughly reengineered in \{OWL\} 2, thus producing a robust platform for future development of the language.},

The goal of classifying simultaneously Ncat = 104 - 105 visual categories requires sub-linear classification costs. We explore algorithms for automatically building classification trees which have, in principle, logNcat complexity. We find that a greedy algorithm that recursively splits the set of categories into the two minimally confused subsets achieves 5-20 fold speedups at a small cost in classification performance. Our approach is independent of the specific classification algorithm used. A welcome by-product of our algorithm is a very reasonable taxonomy of the Caltech-256 dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically detecting a large number of visual concepts in images or video shots. State of the art systems generally involve feature (descriptor) extraction, classification (supervised learning) and fusion when several descriptors and/or classifiers are used. Though direct multi-label approaches are considered in some works, detection scores are often computed independently for each target concept. We propose a method that we call ``conceptual feedback'' which implicitly takes into account the relations between concepts to improve the overall concepts detection performance. A conceptual descriptor is built from the system's output scores and fed back by adding it to the pool of already available descriptors. Our proposal can be iterated several times. Moreover, we propose three extensions of our method. Firstly, a weighting of the conceptual dimensions is performed to give more importance to concepts which are more correlated to the target concept. Secondly, an explicit selection of a set of concepts that are semantically or statically related to the target concept is introduced. For video indexing, we propose a third extension which integrates the temporal dimension in the feedback process by taking into account simultaneously the conceptual and the temporal dimensions to build the high-level descriptor. Our proposals have been evaluated in the context of the TRECVid 2012 semantic indexing task involving the detection of 346 visual or multi-modal concepts. Overall, combined with temporal re-scoring, the proposed method increased the global system performance (MAP) from 0.2613 to 0.3082 ( + 17.9 \% of relative improvement) while the temporal re-scoring alone increased it only from 0.2613 to 0.2691 ( + 3.0 \%).},

The second section discusses real users' queries with respect to the semantic gap. The final sections of the paper describe our own experience in attempting to bridge the semantic gap. In particular we discuss our work on auto-annotation and semantic-space models of image retrieval in order to bridge the gap from the bottom up, and the use of ontologies, which capture more semantics than keyword object labels alone, as a technique for bridging the gap from the top down.},

An aggregate specifies a set of objects with certain properties and relations which together constitute a meaningful scene entity. In this paper we show how ontological concept descriptions for spatially related objects and aggregates can be learnt from positive and negative examples. Our approach features a rich representation language encompassing quantitative and qualitative attributes and relations. Using examples from the buildings domain, we show that learnt aggregate concepts for window arrays, balconies and other structures can be successfully employed in the conceptual knowledge base of a scene interpretation system. Furthermore we argue that our approach can be extended to cover ontological concepts of any kind, with very few restrictions.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of researchers have been building high-level semantic concept detectors such as outdoors, face, building, to help with semantic video retrieval. Our goal is to examine how many concepts would be needed, and how they should be selected and used. Simulating performance of video retrieval under different assumptions of concept detection accuracy, we find that good retrieval can be achieved even when detection accuracy is low, if sufficiently many concepts are combined. We also derive suggestions regarding the types of concepts that would be most helpful for a large concept lexicon. Since our user study finds that people cannot predict which concepts will help their query, we also suggest ways to find the best concepts to use. Ultimately, this paper concludes that "concept-based" video retrieval with fewer than 5000 concepts, detected with a minimal accuracy of 10% mean average precision is likely to provide high accuracy results in broadcast news retrieval.},

  Abstract                 = {The semantic interpretation of images can benefit from representations of useful concepts and the links between them as ontologies. In this paper, we propose an ontology of spatial relations, in order to guide image interpretation and the recognition of the structures it contains using structural information on the spatial arrangement of these structures. As an original theoretical contribution, this ontology is then enriched by fuzzy representations of concepts, which define their semantics, and allow establishing the link between these concepts (which are often expressed in linguistic terms) and the information that can be extracted from images. This contributes to reducing the semantic gap and it constitutes a new methodological approach to guide semantic image interpretation. This methodological approach is illustrated on a medical example, dealing with knowledge-based recognition of brain structures in 3D magnetic resonance images using the proposed fuzzy spatial relation ontology. },

  Abstract                 = { Content-based video retrieval is maturing to the point where it can be used in real-world retrieval practices. One such practice is the audiovisual archive, whose users increasingly require fine-grained access to broadcast television content. In this paper, we take into account the information needs and retrieval data already present in the audiovisual archive, and demonstrate that retrieval performance can be significantly improved when content-based methods are applied to search. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the practice of an audiovisual archive has been taken into account for quantitative retrieval evaluation. To arrive at our main result, we propose an evaluation methodology tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the audiovisual archive, which are typically missed by existing evaluation initiatives. We utilize logged searches, content purchases, session information, and simulators to create realistic query sets and relevance judgments. To reflect the retrieval practice of both the archive and the video retrieval community as closely as possible, our experiments with three video search engines incorporate archive-created catalog entries as well as state-of-the-art multimedia content analysis results. A detailed query-level analysis indicates that individual content-based retrieval methods such as transcript-based retrieval and concept-based retrieval yield approximately equal performance gains. When combined, we find that content-based video retrieval incorporated into the archives practice results in significant performance increases for shot retrieval and for retrieving entire television programs. The time has come for audiovisual archives to start accommodating content-based video retrieval methods into their daily practice. },

  Abstract                 = {Multimedia plays significant role in today's IT world. The revolution of multimedia makes it more familiar to the users because of its expressiveness. Multimedia has a wide range of application in many fields like e-learning, teleconferencing, online medical transcription, etc. Semantic web is an emerging technology to fulfill the user's needs. Over the past decade, lots of research is going on for retrieval of multimedia content in semantic web. This paper discusses various retrieval techniques of multimedia content using ontology for the semantic web. In addition, it discusses the advantages of Text, Image, Video and Audio based retrieval systems. It also presents an analysis based on its merits.},

As a result huge volumes of images and video data are being generated daily. This availability of big video data has created challenges to video processing and analysis. Novel and scalable data management and processing frameworks are needed to meet the challenges posed by the big video data. This paper focuses on the first step in meeting this challenge that is to have high performance processing of big video data using GPUs. Parallel implementation of video object detection algorithm is presented along with fine grain optimization techniques and algorithm innovation. Experimental results show significant speedups of the algorithms resulting in real time processing of HD and beyond HD (like panoramic) resolution videos.},

  Abstract                 = {A semantically meaningful image hierarchy can ease the human effort in organizing thousands and millions of pictures (e.g., personal albums), and help to improve performance of end tasks such as image annotation and classification. Previous work has focused on using either low-level image features or textual tags to build image hierarchies, resulting in limited success in their general usage. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically discover the “semantivisual” image hierarchy by incorporating both image and tag information. This hierarchy encodes a general-to-specific image relationship. We pay particular attention to quantifying the effectiveness of the learned hierarchy, as well as comparing our method with others in the end-task applications. Our experiments show that humans find our semantivisual image hierarchy more effective than those solely based on texts or low-level visual features. And using the constructed image hierarchy as a knowledge ontology, our algorithm can perform challenging image classification and annotation tasks more accurately.},

This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent technical achievements in high-level semantic-based image retrieval. Major recent publications are included in this survey covering different aspects of the research in this area, including low-level image feature extraction, similarity measurement, and deriving high-level semantic features. We identify five major categories of the state-of-the-art techniques in narrowing down the ‘semantic gap’: (1) using object ontology to define high-level concepts; (2) using machine learning methods to associate low-level features with query concepts; (3) using relevance feedback to learn users’ intention; (4) generating semantic template to support high-level image retrieval; (5) fusing the evidences from \{HTML\} text and the visual content of images for \{WWW\} image retrieval. In addition, some other related issues such as image test bed and retrieval performance evaluation are also discussed. Finally, based on existing technology and the demand from real-world applications, a few promising future research directions are suggested. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study evaluates the use of a hierarchical classification approach to automated assessment of essays. Automated essay scoring (AES) generally relies on machine learning techniques that compute essay scores using a set of text variables. Unlike previous studies that rely on regression models, this study computes essay scores using a hierarchical approach, analogous to an incremental algorithm for hierarchical classification. The corpus in this study consists of 1243 argumentative (persuasive) essays written on 14 different prompts, across 3 different grade levels (9th grade, 11th grade, college freshman), and four different time limits for writing or temporal conditions (untimed essays and essays written in 10, 15, and 25&#xa0;minute increments). The features included in the analysis are computed using the automated tools, Coh-Metrix, the Writing Assessment Tool (WAT), and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Overall, the models developed to score all the essays in the data set report 55% exact accuracy and 92% adjacent accuracy between the predicted essay scores and the human scores. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to \{AES\} that could provide more specific feedback to writers and may be relevant to other natural language computations, such as the scoring of short answers in comprehension or knowledge assessments. },

  Abstract                 = {Relevance is a fundamental, though not completely understood, concept for documentation, information science, and information retrieval. This article presents the history of relevance through an exhaustive review of the literature. Such history being very complex (about 160 papers are discussed), it is not simple to describe it in a comprehensible way. Thus, first of all a framework for establishing a common ground is defined, and then the history itself is illustrated via the presentation in chronological order of the papers on relevance. The history is divided into three periods (“Before 1958,” “1959–1976,” and “1977–present”) and, inside each period, the papers on relevance are analyzed under seven different aspects (methodological foundations, different kinds of relevance, beyond-topical criteria adopted by users, modes for expression of the relevance judgment, dynamic nature of relevance, types of document representation, and agreement among different judges). © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Web-scale digital assets comprise millions or billions of documents. Due to such increase, sequential algorithms cannot cope with this data, and parallel and distributed computing become the solution of choice. MapReduce is a programming model proposed by Google for scalable data processing. MapReduce is mainly applicable for data intensive algorithms. In contrast, the message passing interface (MPI) is suitable for high performance algorithms. This paper proposes an adapted structure of the MapReduce programming model using MPI for multimedia indexing. Experimental results are done on various multimedia applications to validate our model. The experiments indicate that our proposed model achieves good speedup compared to the original sequential versions, Hadoop and the earlier versions of MapReduce using MPI.},

  Abstract                 = {What is the story of an image? What is the relationship between pictures, language, and information we can extract using state of the art computational recognition systems? In an attempt to address both of these questions, we explore methods for retrieving and generating natural language descriptions for images. Ideally, we would like our generated textual descriptions (captions) to both sound like a person wrote them, and also remain true to the image content. To do this we develop data-driven approaches for image description generation, using retrieval-based techniques to gather either: (a) whole captions associated with a visually similar image, or (b) relevant bits of text (phrases) from a large collection of image + description pairs. In the case of (b), we develop optimization algorithms to merge the retrieved phrases into valid natural language sentences. The end result is two simple, but effective, methods for harnessing the power of big data to produce image captions that are altogether more general, relevant, and human-like than previous attempts.},

  Abstract                 = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

  Abstract                 = {{Despite the recent advances in search quality, the fast increase in the size of the Web collection has introduced new challenges for Web ranking algorithms. In fact, there are still many situations in which the users are presented with imprecise or very poor results. One of the key difficulties is the fact that users usually submit very short and ambiguous queries, and they do not fully specify their information needs. That is, it is necessary to improve the query formation process if better answers are to be provided. The proposed system is a revised concept-based query expansion technique, which allows disambiguating queries submitted to search engines. The concepts are extracted by analyzing log files and query relations mined using association rules. The concepts related to the current query are then shown to the user who selects the concept that he interprets is most related to his query. This concept is used to expand the original query and the expanded query is processed instead. Using a Web test collection of stock news articles this technique has been implemented and it can be clearly seen from the results that the proposed system leads to gains in precision. The proposed system attempts to improvise the performance of the vector space model system and provide relevant documents to the user based on the context.}},

More specifically, the developed infrastruc- ture consists of the core ontology based on extensions of the {DOLCE} core ontology and the multimedia-specific infrastructure components. These are, the Visual Descriptors Ontology, which is based on an {RDFS} representation of the {MPEG}-7 Visual Descriptors and the Multimedia Structure Ontology, based on the {MPEG}-7 {MDS}. Furthermore, the de- veloped Visual Descriptor Extraction tool is presented, which will sup- port the initialization of domain ontologies with multimedia features.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that \{CNNs\} are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying \{CNNs\} to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make \{CNNs\} effective compared to \{DNNs\} for \{LVCSR\} tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by \{CNNs\} as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the \{CNN\} framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 \{LVCSR\} tasks indicate that a \{CNN\} with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12%–14% relative improvement in \{WER\} over a strong \{DNN\} system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks. },

The probability theory is based on perception and has only two outcomes (true or false). Fuzzy theory is based on linguistic information and is extended to handle the concept of partial truth. Fuzzy values are determined between true or false. Fuzzy theory was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh as a means to model the uncertainty of natural language. From mathematical perspective, fuzzy and probability exist as part of information theory, which represent uncertainty. This paper describes about the similarity and difference between fuzzy and probability. Furthermore, the application of fuzzy logic in control system is described.},

The paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval: patterns of use, types of pictures, the role of semantics, and the sensory gap. Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap},

  Abstract                 = { Efficient and effective handling of video documents depends on the availability of indexes. Manual indexing is unfeasible for large video collections. In this paper we survey several methods aiming at automating this time and resource consuming process. Good reviews on single modality based video indexing have appeared in literature. Effective indexing, however, requires a multimodal approach in which either the most appropriate modality is selected or the different modalities are used in collaborative fashion. Therefore, instead of separately treating the different information sources involved, and their specific algorithms, we focus on the similarities and differences between the modalities. To that end we put forward a unifying and multimodal framework, which views a video document from the perspective of its author. This framework forms the guiding principle for identifying index types, for which automatic methods are found in literature. It furthermore forms the basis for categorizing these different methods. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the organization and retrieval of records in document retrieval systems which admit of imprecision in the form of fuzziness in document characterization and retrieval rules. A mathematical model for such systems, based on the theory of fuzzy sets, is introduced. A document retrieval system, as defined in this paper, is a quadruple (X, D, Q, γ), where X is a collection of the document descriptions (also referred to as index records, or records); D is the descriptor set; Q is a query set; γ: QxX → [0, 1], (called the matching function) assigns to each pair (q, x) where q ϵ Q and x ϵ X, a number γ(q, x) in the interval [0, 1], called the matching index for the query q and the document description x. In our system model, each document description x is defined as a fuzzy set in the descriptor set D. As a fuzzy subset of D, each x is characterized by a membership function μx: D → [0, 1], where μx(d), representing the grade of membership of d in x, is referred to as the index weight of the descriptor d for the document representation x. The retrieval response of the system is defined in terms of the matching function γ. More specifically, given a query q, the index record retrieval response, f(q), is defined to be a fuzzy set in X whose membership function is given by μƒ(q)(x) = γ(q, x). To deal with the organization problems of data in our conceptual model, the conventional concept of a list is extended to a fuzzy list. Specifically, L(d), the fuzzy list corresponding to a descriptor d, is defined as a fuzzy set in the document description set X whose membership function is given by μl(d)(x) = μx, (d). In this way, the notion of an inverted file structure can be extended to the fuzzy data in our retrieval model.},

Such history can be provided by simulation runs or gathered from a monitoring system. A test case is described and then used to show how different software tools can be integrated to support the integrated design and evaluation of a production system.},

  Abstract                 = {With the explosive growth of video data, content-based video analysis and management technologies such as indexing, browsing and retrieval have drawn much attention. Video shot boundary detection (SBD) is usually the first and important step for those technologies. Great efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of SBD algorithms. However, most works are based on signal rather than interpretable features of frames. In this paper, we propose a novel video shot boundary detection framework based on interpretable TAGs learned by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Firstly, we adopt a candidate segment selection to predict the positions of shot boundaries and discard most non-boundary frames. This preprocessing method can help to improve both accuracy and speed of the SBD algorithm. Then, cut transition and gradual transition detections which are based on the interpretable TAGs are conducted to identify the shot boundaries in the candidate segments. Afterwards, we synthesize the features of frames in a shot and get semantic labels for the shot. Experiments on TRECVID 2001 test data show that the proposed scheme can achieve a better performance compared with the state-of-the-art schemes. Besides, the semantic labels obtained by the framework can be used to depict the content of a shot.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper is concerned with content-based image retrieval from a stochastic point of view. The semantic gap problem is addressed in two ways. First, a dimensional reduction is applied using the (pre-calculated) distances among images. The dimension of the reduced vector is the number of preferences that we allow the user to choose from, in this case, three levels. Second, the conditional probability distribution of the random user preference, given this reduced feature vector, is modeled using a proportional odds model. A new model is fitted at each iteration. The score used to rank the image database is based on the estimated probability function of the random preference. Additionally, some memory is incorporated in the procedure by weighting the current and previous scores. Also, a novel evaluation procedure is proposed in this work based on the empirical commutative distribution functions of the relevant and non-relevant retrieved images. Good experimental results are achieved in very different experimental setups and tested in different databases. },

  Abstract                 = {The application of machine learning techniques to image and video search has been shown to boost the performance of multimedia retrieval systems, and promises to lead to more generalized semantic search approaches. In particular, the availability of large training collections allows model-driven search using a substantial number of semantic concepts. The training collections are obtained in a manual annotation process where human raters review images and assign predefined semantic concept labels. Besides being prone to human error, manual image annotation is biased by the view of the individual annotator because visual information almost always leaves room for ambiguity. Ideally, several independent judgments are obtained per image, and the inter-rater agreement is assessed. While disagreement between ratings bears valuable information on the annotation quality, it complicates the task of clearly classifying rated images based on multiple judgments. In the absence of a gold standard, evaluating multiple judgments and resolving disagreement between raters is not trivial. In this paper, we present an approach using latent structure analysis to solve this problem. We apply latent class modeling to the annotation data collected during the TRECVID 2005 Annotation Forum, and demonstrate how to use this statistic to clearly classify each image on the basis of varying numbers of ratings. We use latent class modeling to quantify the annotation quality and discuss the results in comparison with the well-known Kappa inter-rater agreement measure.},

  Abstract                 = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) relies on partial supervision information for prediction, where only a small set of samples are associated with labels. Performance of SSL is significantly degraded if the given labels are not reliable. Such problems arise in realistic applications such as Web image search using noisy textual tags. This paper proposes a novel and efficient graph based SSL method with the unique capacity of pruning contradictory labels and inferring new labels through a bidirectional and alternating optimization process. The objective is to automatically identify the most suitable samples for manipulation, labeling or unlabeling, and meanwhile estimate a smooth classification function over a weighted graph. Different from other graph based SSL approaches, the proposed method employs a bivariate objective function and iteratively modifies label variables on both labeled and unlabeled samples. Starting from such a SSL setting, we present a relearning framework to improve the performance of base learner, particularly for the application of Web image search. Besides the toy demonstration on artificial data, we evaluated the proposed method on flicker image search with unreliable textual labels. Experimental results confirm the significant improvements of the method over the baseline text based search engine and the state-of-the-art SSL methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents a new architecture of a fuzzy decision tree based on fuzzy rules – fuzzy rule based decision tree (FRDT) and provides a learning algorithm. In contrast with “traditional” axis-parallel decision trees in which only a single feature (variable) is taken into account at each node, the node of the proposed decision trees involves a fuzzy rule which involves multiple features. Fuzzy rules are employed to produce leaves of high purity. Using multiple features for a node helps us minimize the size of the trees. The growth of the \{FRDT\} is realized by expanding an additional node composed of a mixture of data coming from different classes, which is the only non-leaf node of each layer. This gives rise to a new geometric structure endowed with linguistic terms which are quite different from the “traditional” oblique decision trees endowed with hyperplanes as decision functions. A series of numeric studies are reported using data coming from \{UCI\} machine learning data sets. The comparison is carried out with regard to “traditional” decision trees such as C4.5, LADtree, BFTree, SimpleCart, and NBTree. The results of statistical tests have shown that the proposed \{FRDT\} exhibits the best performance in terms of both accuracy and the size of the produced trees. },

  Abstract                 = {Large video collections such as YouTube contain many different video genres, while in many applications the user might be interested in one or two specific video genres only. Thus, when users are querying the system with a specific semantic concept like AnchorPerson, and MovieStars, they are likely aiming a genre specific instantiation of this concept. Existing methods treat this problem as a classical learning problem leading to unnecessarily complex models. We propose a framework to detect visual-based genre-specific concepts in a more efficient and accurate way. We do so by using a two-step framework distinguishing two different levels. Genre-specific concept models are trained based on a training set with data labeled at video level for genres and at shot level for semantic concepts. In the classification stage, video genre classification is applied first to reduce the entire data set to a relatively small subset. Then, the genre-specific concept models are applied to this subset only. Experiments have been conducted on a small 28-h data set for genre-specific concept detection and a 4168-h (80 thinspace031 videos) benchmark data set for genre-specific topic search. Experimental results show that our proposed two-step method is more efficient and effective than existing methods which do not consider the different semantic levels between video genres and semantic concepts for both the indexing and the search tasks. When filtering out 80% of the data set, the average performance loss is about 11.3% for genre-specific concept detection and 31.5% for genre-specific topic search, while the processing speed increases hundreds of times for different video genres.},

In this paper, we discuss the application of deep learning method in the six multimedia analysis tasks, and also point out the future directions of deep learning in multimedia analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an image parsing to text description (I2T) framework that generates text descriptions of image and video content based on image understanding. The proposed I2T framework follows three steps: 1) input images (or video frames) are decomposed into their constituent visual patterns by an image parsing engine, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in natural language; 2) the image parsing results are converted into semantic representation in the form of Web ontology language (OWL), which enables seamless integration with general knowledge bases; and 3) a text generation engine converts the results from previous steps into semantically meaningful, human readable, and query-able text reports. The centerpiece of the I2T framework is an and-or graph (AoG) visual knowledge representation, which provides a graphical representation serving as prior knowledge for representing diverse visual patterns and provides top-down hypotheses during the image parsing. The AoG embodies vocabularies of visual elements including primitives, parts, objects, scenes as well as a stochastic image grammar that specifies syntactic relations (i.e., compositional) and semantic relations (e.g., categorical, spatial, temporal, and functional) between these visual elements. Therefore, the AoG is a unified model of both categorical and symbolic representations of visual knowledge. The proposed I2T framework has two objectives. First, we use semiautomatic method to parse images from the Internet in order to build an AoG for visual knowledge representation. Our goal is to make the parsing process more and more automatic using the learned AoG model. Second, we use automatic methods to parse image/video in specific domains and generate text reports that are useful for real-world applications. In the case studies at the end of this paper, we demonstrate two automatic I2T systems: a maritime and urban scene video surveillance system and a real-time automatic driving scene understan- - ding system.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the current era of digital communication, the use of digital images has increased for expressing, sharing and interpreting information. While working with digital images, quite often it is necessary to search for a specific image for a particular situation based on the visual contents of the image. This task looks easy if you are dealing with tens of images but it gets more difficult when the number of images goes from tens to hundreds and thousands, and the same content-based searching task becomes extremely complex when the number of images is in the millions. To deal with the situation, some intelligent way of content-based searching is required to fulfill the searching request with right visual contents in a reasonable amount of time. There are some really smart techniques proposed by researchers for efficient and robust content-based image retrieval. In this research, the aim is to highlight the efforts of researchers who conducted some brilliant work and to provide a proof of concept for intelligent content-based image retrieval techniques. },

In this paper cognitive uncertainties involved in classification problems are explicitly represented, measured, and incorporated into the knowledge induction process.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The conventional wisdom is that the concept of information is closely related to the concept of probability. In Shannon’s information theory, information is equated to a reduction in entropy—a probabilistic concept. In this paper, a different view of information is put on the table. Information is equated to restriction. More concretely, a restriction is a limitation on the values which a variable can take. The concept of a restriction is more general than the concept of a constraint and the concept of a probability distribution. There are three principal kinds of restrictions: possibilistic, probabilistic and bimodal. A bimodal restriction is a combination of possibilistic and probabilistic restrictions. Underlying the restriction-centered approach to information is what may be called the Information Principle. Briefly stated, the Information Principle has three parts. (a) Information = restriction. (b) There are three principal types of information: possibilistic information, probabilistic information and bimodal information. Bimodal information is a combination of possibilistic information and probabilistic information. (c) Possibilistic information and probabilistic information are underivable (orthogonal), in the sense that neither is derivable from the other. Information is all around us. And yet, there is widespread unawareness of the existence of the Information Principle. In particular, what is not recognized is that possibilistic information and probabilistic information are underivable (orthogonal). An important empirical observation is that propositions in a natural language are carriers of predominantly fuzzy possibilistic information (FPI) and fuzzy bimodal information (FBI). Existing systems of reasoning and computation—other than fuzzy logic—do not have the capability to reason and compute with fuzzy bimodal information. },

  Abstract                 = {Multimedia environmental modeling is extremely complex due to the intricacy of the systems with the consideration of many related factors. Traditional environmental multimedia models (EMMs) are usually based on one-dimensional and first-order assumptions, which may cause numerical errors in the simulation results. In this study, a new user-friendly fuzzy-set enhanced environmental multimedia modeling system (FEEMMS) is developed, and includes four key modules: an air dispersion module, a polluting source module, an unsaturated zone module, and a groundwater module. Many improvements over previous EMMs have been achieved through dynamically quantifying the intermedia mass flux; incorporating fuzzy-set approach into environmental multimedia modeling system (EMMS); and designing a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI). The developed FEEMMS can be a useful tool in estimating the time-varying and spatial-varying chemical concentrations in air, soil, and groundwater; characterizing the potential risk to human health presented by contaminants released from a contaminated site; and quantifying the uncertainties associated with modeling systems and subsequently providing robustness and flexibility for the remediation-related decision making.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning discriminative dictionaries for image content representation plays a critical role in visual recognition. In this paper, we present a joint dictionary learning (JDL) algorithm which exploits the inter-category visual correlations to learn more discriminative dictionaries. Given a group of visually correlated categories, JDL simultaneously learns one common dictionary and multiple category-specific dictionaries to explicitly separate the shared visual atoms from the category-specific ones. The problem of JDL is formulated as a joint optimization with a discrimination promotion term according to the Fisher discrimination criterion. A visual tree method is developed to cluster a large number of categories into a set of disjoint groups, so that each of them contains a reasonable number of visually correlated categories. The process of image category clustering helps JDL to learn better dictionaries for classification by ensuring that the categories in the same group are of strong visual correlations. Also, it makes JDL to be computationally affordable in large-scale applications. Three classification schemes are adopted to make full use of the dictionaries learned by JDL for visual content representation in the task of image categorization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated using two image databases containing 17 and 1,000 categories, respectively.},

To achieve a high QoS for multimedia services, we propose a media-edge cloud (MEC) architecture, in which storage, central processing unit (CPU), and graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters are presented at the edge to provide distributed parallel processing and QoS adaptation for various types of devices.},
