  Abstract                 = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

This is applied to a benchmark experimental model taken here as a DC motor subject to wide range of varying load parameters and external disturbances. The results obtained using an integrated scheme of the optimized Takagi Sugeno scheme are compared with those of a dynamical neural network based scheme. It is shown that significant improvements could be made over the conventional static PID-controller, in particular for load disturbance recovery},

PBIL and a traditional genetic algorithm are compared on the task of evolving a neural network-based controller for a simulated robotic agent. In particular, this paper examines the performance of FP-PBIL, a variant of PBIL developed for this task that works with floating-point representations rather than bit-strings. Results are presented showing the superior performance of FP-PBIL. This advantage, combined with lower memory and processing requirements indicate that the technique is well-suited to developing online, evolutionary controllers for autonomous robotic agents},
